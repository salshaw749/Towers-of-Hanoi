# Towers of Hanoi

----- 

### Introduction
The idea behind this small project is to research, brainstorm, and build a basic terminal program by using `Stack Data Structure and Nodes`. So i'voe chose to build Towers of Hanoi which is an ancient mathematical puzzle that starts off with three stacks and many disks.

### The algorithm 
Build a basic algorithm that will ask each user to enter where they want to move the disk.
The objective is to move the stack of disks from the leftmost stack to the rightmost stack.

The game follows three rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

### Development Setup
For this project you don't need any dependencies or libraries. Just make sure that you've installed python3, you can check by oppening your terminal and write  `python -V`.
However, you can pull the files and start plying from your terminal! By writting this command `python3 script.py`.
ENJOY!
